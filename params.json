  "body": "### Who Am I?\r\nWell, for starters, I'm Stephen Lindauer. I'm a 28 year old Apple fanboy, University of Missouri - Columbia graduate, motorcycle rider, hockey fan, and craft beer lover. Oh, and I write code sometimes too. \r\n\r\n### Past Work\r\n\r\n![Past work screenshots](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CuoEoZWUEAAaDZa.jpg:large)\r\n\r\n**Missouri4Koster:** Client project for Missouri's Attorney General, Chris Koster. This was a contact manager on steroids. The app tracked and helped him remember the people he met over the past 4 years during campaigning.\r\n\r\n**[Baselife](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/baselife/id1095569782?mt=8):** Personal project. Think social media network meets yelp, but for military personnel. During my time in the Army, I realized the need for something to bring soldiers together and help them finding things to do around base. Baselife allows soldiers to communicate within their units and see events they can attend instead of sitting in the barracks all the time.\r\n\r\n**[DrumpfTower](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drumpf-tower/id1143363459?mt=8):** Personal project. Remember back in August 2016 when some guy tried to climb Trump Tower? Well, I was so inspired that I made a game out of it. You climb the tower and tear down campaign posters while trying to avoid obstacles. \r\n\r\n**[Fish-e](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fish-e/id1046398556?mt=8):** Personal project. Wanting to learn Apple's SpriteKit, I decided to remake an old Flash game I used to play in high school, [Fishy](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.freegameaccess.com%2Fimages%2Ffishy-big.jpg&f=1).\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.",
