  "body": "### Who Am I?\r\nWell, for starters, I'm Stephen Lindauer. I'm a 28 year old Apple fanboy, University of Missouri - Columbia graduate, motorcycle rider, hockey fan, and craft beer lover. Oh, and I write code sometimes too. \r\n\r\n### What's My Story?\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n### My Past Projects\r\n\r\n![Past work screenshots](https://s3.amazonaws.com/stephenlindauer/app-screenshots.png)\r\n\r\n**Missouri4Koster:** Client project for Missouri's Attorney General, Chris Koster. This was a contact manager on steroids. The app tracked and helped him remember the people he met over the past 4 years during campaigning.\r\n\r\n**[Baselife](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/baselife/id1095569782?mt=8):** Personal project. Think social media network meets yelp, but for military personnel. During my time in the Army, I realized the need for something to bring soldiers together and help them find things to do around base. Baselife allows soldiers to communicate within their units and see events they can attend instead of sitting in the barracks twiddling their thumbs.\r\n\r\n**[DrumpfTower](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drumpf-tower/id1143363459?mt=8):** Personal project. Remember back in August 2016 when some guy tried to climb Trump Tower? Well, I was so inspired that I made a game out of it. You climb the tower and tear down campaign posters while trying to avoid obstacles. \r\n\r\n**[Fish-e](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fish-e/id1046398556?mt=8):** Personal project. Wanting to learn Apple's SpriteKit, I decided to remake an old Flash game I used to play in high school, [Fishy](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.freegameaccess.com%2Fimages%2Ffishy-big.jpg&f=1).\r\n",
