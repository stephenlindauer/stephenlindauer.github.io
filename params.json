  "body": "### Who Am I?\r\nWell, for starters, I'm Stephen Lindauer. I'm a 28 year old Apple fanboy, University of Missouri-Columbia graduate, motorcycle rider, hockey fan, and craft beer lover. Oh, and I write code sometimes too. \r\n\r\n### What's My Story?\r\nI started programming when I was 14, making text based games in GW-BASIC. It was love at first sight. I spent all my free time learning everything I could about programming and computers in general. I attended University of Missouri-Columbia where I got my bachelors degree in Computer Science. My internship at CARFAX turned into a full time job, and that's when I started getting into iOS development. After one year full time at CARFAX, I quit and started working for myself, doing client projects and cofounding a startup called [Nightlife](https://nightlifetonight.com). For three years, Nightlife continued to grow, expanding to 25 cities across the US, while I continued to work on client projects to pay the bills. In 2013, I stepped away from Nightlife, ended most of my client projects, and enlisted in the U.S. Army as an Intelligence Analyst. But even during my time in the Army, I couldn't stop my true passion. Over the last year, I've released two games and one social media app on the App Store, while continuing work on a client project for Missouri's Attorney General, Chris Koster. Now, my time in the Army is coming to an end and I'm looking to get back to a coding full time.\r\n\r\n### My Past Projects\r\n\r\n![Past work screenshots](https://s3.amazonaws.com/stephenlindauer/app-screenshots.png)\r\n\r\n**Missouri4Koster (M4K):** Client project for Missouri's Attorney General, Chris Koster. This was a contact manager on steroids. The app tracked and helped him remember the people he met over the past 4 years during campaigning.\r\n\r\n**[Baselife](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/baselife/id1095569782?mt=8):** Personal project. Think social media network meets yelp, but for military personnel. During my time in the Army, I realized the need for something to bring soldiers together and help them find things to do around base. Baselife allows soldiers to communicate within their units and see events they can attend instead of sitting in the barracks twiddling their thumbs.\r\n\r\n**[DrumpfTower](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drumpf-tower/id1143363459?mt=8):** Personal project. Remember back in August 2016 when some guy tried to climb Trump Tower? Well, I was so inspired that I made a game out of it. You climb the tower and tear down campaign posters while trying to avoid obstacles. _(I have no political affiliation.)_\r\n\r\n**[Fish-e](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fish-e/id1046398556?mt=8):** Personal project. Wanting to learn Apple's SpriteKit, I decided to remake an old Flash game I used to play in high school, [Fishy](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.freegameaccess.com%2Fimages%2Ffishy-big.jpg&f=1).\r\n\r\n**[Nightlife](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nightlife/id521945530):** Startup, cofounder. Nightlife helps connect users with the latest happy hours, drink specials, concerts, and events.\r\n",
