  "body": "### Who Am I?\r\nWell, for starters, I'm Stephen Lindauer. I'm a 28 year old Apple fanboy, University of Missouri - Columbia graduate, motorcycle rider, hockey fan, and craft beer lover. Oh, and I write code sometimes too. \r\n\r\n### Past Work\r\n![Missouri4Koster](https://s3.amazonaws.com/stephenlindauer/Simulator+Screen+Shot+Nov+18%2C+2016%2C+9.44.54+PM.png)\r\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pnnapp/media/images/reg/6c02bcba58438aa2f8d706efcf1b7678.jpg)\r\n**Missouri4Koster:** Client project for Missouri's Attorney General, Chris Koster. This was a contact manager on steroids. The app tracked and helped him remember the people he met over the past 4 years during campaigning.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.",
